This package shall contain everything that's related to *learning* in the RackKI project.

Next points that will be addressed:
- A dedicated assembly environment for data creation with teleoperation. No
  robots, just assembly components and interfaces for interaction and data
  recording.
- Scripts and algorithmic implementations to learn skills from these data with
  a special focus on *Offline RL*.
